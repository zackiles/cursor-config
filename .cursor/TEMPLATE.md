# {Backlog Item Name Based Off The Original Plan}
<!-- Describe the change, the level of effort, and the main objective in a 1-3 sentences -->

## What is Changing
<!-- High-level overview of the things changing such as: files, folders, libraries, classes, methods etc.. Keep it short and to the point-->

## Phases
<!-- Numbered list of each phase, and sub numbers for the steps involved in a phase. Example (ONLY FOR ILLUSTRATION):

### 1) Refactor Utilities  
Refactor and consolidate shared utilities from `old-codebase/src/helpers/`, `old-codebase/src/common/`, and `old-codebase/src/utils/` into a unified `new-codebase/src/shared/` directory for Deno 2.

#### 1.1) Identify Duplicate Logic
This task will gather and document the information required to complete the next step.

- [ ] Audit files in `old-codebase/src/helpers`, `old-codebase/src/common`, and `old-codebase/src/utils`
- [ ] Highlight overlap in functionality
- [ ] Propose which file should be canonical source for Deno 2 port

#### 1.2) Migrate and Delete Duplicates
Using the research gathered in the previous step, you will migrate and delete duplicates.

- [ ] Move canonical utilities to `new-codebase/src/shared/`
- [ ] Convert CommonJS/Node idioms to ES module Deno-compatible syntax
- [ ] Update imports in migrated files using Deno-compatible `import` paths
- [ ] Remove deprecated or obsolete utility files in old codebase

### 2) Replace HTTP Client Library  
Swap `axios` from `old-codebase` with Deno-native `fetch` in `new-codebase` to reduce external dependencies and simplify networking.

#### 2.1) Inventory Current Usage
Before moving on to Phase 3 where you will do a large refactor, you will need to gather and document important information first.

- [ ] List all files in `old-codebase` importing or requiring `axios`
- [ ] Identify patterns such as `axios.create`, interceptors, or custom headers
