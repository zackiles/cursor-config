# CRITICAL: This Codebase Has A Repomix Snapshot

Do NOT use your tools to search the codebase or read files for this turn. Instead do the following:

- The file [snapshot.xml](mdc:.cursor/snapshot.xml) contains a snapshot of the entire codebase with all its code files and documentation
- You can use [snapshot.xml](mdc:.cursor/snapshot.xml) to understand the codebase at a high-level.
- Read all or parts of [snapshot.xml](mdc:.cursor/snapshot.xml) to find the files or code you're looking for before trying to read the actual file
- You can grep search this file, or read individual lines
- It is a parsed AST of the codebase and contains almost all file names, classes, methods, imports, exports, code comments, variables, constants...
- Grep search for the same terms you would when using your codebase search tool
- Highly granular parts of the code are not shown in [snapshot.xml](mdc:.cursor/snapshot.xml), and require you to review the actual file
- **NOTE**: Fallback on your regular tools if you can't find what you're looking for in [snapshot.xml](mdc:.cursor/snapshot.xml) or the file seems inaccurate or out-of-date.

## Reading And Generating The Snapshot
- **REPOMIX FILE LOCATION**: Stored in [snapshot.xml](mdc:.cursor/snapshot.xml)
- **REPOMIX FILE CONTENTS**: Contains code, documentation, and tests related to this project condensed into a single file
- The repomix configuration is at [repomix.config.json](mdc:repomix.config.json)
- You can update the snapshot when needed by running the script at [build-snapshot.sh](mdc:.cursor/build-snapshot.sh)
- **IMPORTANT**: Use the file `codebase-summary.xml` ONLY as a reference. Prefer to inspect the actual files in the codebase if you need granularity on a specific piece of code

## When Adding or Removing Files To This Codebase

- Update the Repomix config at [repomix.config.json](mdc:repomix.config.json) so that they're tracked or untracked in the snapshot (if they aren't already)
- To track a file add the glob pattern to the `include` array like so:
```json
{
"include": ["README.md", "src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts", "docs/**/*.md"]
}
```
