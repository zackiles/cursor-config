# CURSORIGNOREINDEX: The following globs will be ignore files from automatic indexing in cursor. Things in `.cursorignore` don't need to be added here!
# Purpose: for files you'd still like cursor to be able to access in prompts or in agent mode, but DON'T want it indexed.
# Indexing files automatically places it in the context window of ALL prompts (if its determined relevant).
# That can causes issues, such as an out of date README.md which is providing it bad context.

# CAUTION: you might actually need a file that matches these to be indexed. If so, add them to overrides below.
# I intentionally ignore documentation, logs, and configuration by default as to not pollute the context.

docs/
